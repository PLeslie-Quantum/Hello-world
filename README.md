# Hello-world
Just something to begin using Github.
As of right now, I'm only 14, (turning 15 on dec30!) and I already am so excited about learnin ghow to code! Hi, I'm Peyton, and my dream is to become a quantum researcher. Big goal, right? I know. Which is why I'm working hard to prove that I can do it. I live in Missisippi, which means that I don't really have many resources as other states. But that won't stop me! All my life, I've never truly known what I wanted to do. I've always made good grades, and have always been told how good I am at certain things. Despite that, I felt like I was living mindlessly, even as a child. But now, I've found something I can be passionate about. My goal is to leaern something new, and share my newfound knowledge with everyone, while learning from others aswell. I have alot planned for myself. Soon, I'll make a social media account to share my journey alongside math and physics, blurring the line between science and art.  How exciting! Will you join me alongside my journey?
